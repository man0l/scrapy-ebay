Helps with low fat cooking as the ribbed bottom pan lets you keep foods from simmering in fatty drippings. Cast-iron is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with slow-cooking recipes and all your favorite foods. Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching. It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time. Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations. Made of cast iron, this cookware evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron grill pan looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. This pre-seasoned cookware is ready-to-use right out of the box. While the skillet comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use. The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then its baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron. This seasoning process achieves a seasoned finish that would take many months of home use to achieve. Sometimes during this process, the seasoning oil can collect and create a bubble or slight drip at the bottom of the pan as its hanging through the production process. And that in turn can turn brown as its processed through the seasoning ovens.  This brown spot is not rust but in fact, carbonized seasoning and will darken with use.  The factory seasoning process makes Lodge cast iron products ready to use right out of the box, and the product over time Just keeps getting better. After cooking, clean with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to utensil while it is still warm. Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made. It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware. The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century.\n\n\nRibbed bottom for low-fat cooking\nPre-Seasoned and ready-to-use\nSuperior heat retention and even cooking\nUse on all cooking surfaces, grills, campfires and oven safe\nMade in the USA\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDelivery & Shipping\n\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION\n\n\nMost orders are shipped within one business day with standard shipping and tracking number.

The Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket Component is a strong, machined aluminum base containing a powerful, circular magnet centered with flexible silicon that attaches to the center of the back of your phone or hard case. The Steelie Ball Mount Component also features a machined aluminum base topped with a steel ball that can be attached anywhere on your dashboard. The two connect magnetically, and, once your phone is in place, keep it securely positioned, even if you accidentally hit that speed bump a little faster than you intended. The Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket's silicon center creates a smooth glide and firm grip, so you can easily rotate the phone from landscape to portrait position and it stays that way until you turn it again. And, because of its fumble-free design, unlike other phone holders, the Nite Ize Steelie Car Mount Kit is legal in all 50 United States. Here's an added bonus: when you've reached your destination and you detach your phone from the Ball Mount, the Magnetic Phone Socket still works with any other convenient metal surface. So you can attach your phone to refrigerator doors, metal shelving, filing cabinets, toolbox tops, even grocery cart handles-and keep it usable, secure, and easy to view throughout your day. The Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket contains a strong magnet. These magnets will NOT damage your tablet or phone. However, do not place new magnetically sensitive objects such as credit cards, pacemakers or computer hard drives. Steelie assumes no liability for damage to such objects.The Steelie Car Mount Kit allows secure attachment for any mobile device, with or without a rigid case, to any vehicle dash with unlimited viewing angles.Each Steelie Car Mount Kit includes one Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket, one Steelie Ball Mount, an alcohol prep pad, 3M primer, and installation instructions.Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket features a powerful neodymium magnet and silicon center to provide a strong grip and smooth glide. The neodymium magnet is safe for use with all phones and tablets.Features 3M Primer. We recommend it be used when attaching the Ball Mount Component to a vinyl vehicle dash to create a durable bond.\n \n\n\n\n\nDelivery & Shipping\n\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION\n\n\nMost orders are shipped within one business day with standard shipping and tracking number.

Chlorine is a type of disinfectant added to water to control microbes, yet harmful by-products can form from chlorine, such as total trihalomethanes (TTHMs). Depending on the geographic area, water can also be contaminated with everything from industrial and agricultural pollutants to heavy metals, sediments, and trace levels of pharmaceuticals. The PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher Filter reduces lead, 99.9 percent of microbiological cysts (cryptosporidium and giardia), and can remove over 96% of trace levels of pharmaceuticals--all while retaining the beneficial fluoride in drinking water. The 2-Stage design has an activated carbon microfilter layer to reduce sediment, chlorine taste and odor, chlorination by-products like TTHMs, and agricultural and industrial pollutants. An additional layer is added to trap sediment.\nA single filter provides up to 40 gallons (1 to 2 months) of clean water, and should be replaced after this period. Available in 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-Packs, this replacement filter is meant for use only with the PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher and Dispenser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our patented, premium carbon filter makes PUR the first leading pitcher filter that removes 99% of microbial cysts. It also reduces chlorine (taste and odor) and 96% of trace levels of pharmaceuticals, giving you clean, great-tasting water. Yet it still leaves behind beneficial fluoride.  Pharmaceutical reduction is not certified by NSF/ANSI or state standard. Based on manufacturer testing for average reduction in trace levels of 12 pharmaceuticals. May not be present in all users water. \"If air pockets become trapped within the filter, this can prohibit or slow down water flow considerably. To remedy this, we would suggest a secondary 15 minute soak of the filter. Once complete, shake the filter while it is submerged to remove any remaining air pockets or bubbles within the filter. After this, turn the filter upright and gently tap it against the sink to compact the contents of the filter. This should help restore proper water flow.\n\n \nProduct Features\n Removes 2x more contaminants than the leading pitcher filter 1 Provides 40 gallons or up to 2 months of clean filtered water per filter.\n\n \n \nCompare\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Type\n\n\nAdvanced MineralClearTM Faucet Mounts\n \n\n\nBasic ClassicClearTM Faucet Mounts\n \n\n\nPitchers and Dispenser\n\n\n\n\nProduct Options\nPUR Horizontal MountPUR Vertical MountPUR Flavor Options\nPUR Faucet Mounts\n\nPUR 18 cup DispenserPUR PitcherPUR Flavor Options Pitcher\n\n\n\nCorresponding Filter\nMineralClearTM Faucet MountFilter RF-9999\nClassicClearTM Faucet Mount Filter RF-3375\nPitcherFilter CRF-950Z\n\n\nNo Refilling Required\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Filter Life\n3 months\n3 months\n2 months\n\n\nWater Filtered per Filter\n100 gallons\n100 gallons\n40 gallons\n\n\nLeaves Fluoride in Water\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters Over Natural Minerals2\n\n \n \n\n\nContaminants Reducedper NSF certification\n61\n61\n14\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPackage includes 4 filters for use with the PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher and Dispenser\nReduces lead, 99.9 percent of microbiological cysts, and over 96% trace levels of pharmaceuticals while retaining beneficial fluoride\n2-Stage design with activated carbon microfilter layer to reduce contaminants and a layer to trap sediment\nSingle filter provides up to 40 gallons (1 to 2 months) of clean water and should be replaced after this period\nAvailable in 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-Packs\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDelivery & Shipping\n\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION\n\n\nMost orders are shipped within one business day with standard shipping and tracking number.

Before its introduction in 1998, crank or pull-tab salad spinners were considered high-end products. Some people even used the spin cycle of their washing machine to dry lettuce. The easy-to-use OXO Salad Spinner turned the tool into an everyday kitchen essential.\nFun Fact: Recently, OXO's Salad Spinner was turned into a portable centrifuge to diagnose anemia in rural parts of the world.\nProblems Identified\n\nDifficult to Start: Pull-string and crank-style spinners require fine motor skills and strength to begin the spinning motion.\nSoggy Lettuce: Some salad spinners do not achieve high levels of RPM, leaving users with damp lettuce that has to be \"towel-dried\" before serving.\nCumbersome to Operate: Spinners commonly spin out of control on countertops unless one hand is holding it down tightly while the other is pulling or cranking.\nTroublesome to Clean: It is not uncommon for lettuce to get caught in the lid of a salad spinner.\n\n\nEarly OXO Salad Spinner Prototype\n\nThe Process\n\nPush of a button: During user research, the development team learned that people inherently enjoy the action of pressing down on a button. Not only is it fun and easy to do, but it gives them a sense of satisfaction that something is working.\nUse the force: Early in the development process, the designer actually calculated the surface tension of water droplets on lettuce. This helped determine the precise level of centrifugal force required dislodge the water and dry the lettuce without damaging it.\nWeeble-Wobble: The centrifugal force required to dry lettuce without bruising it was so high that the Spinner had a tendency to walk or wobble all over the countertop. Because of this, users had to use two hands  one to pump and the other to hold the Spinner steady.\nA Separate Piece: Our first attempt at a take-apart lid included pull tabs that held the lid securely together, but required too much force to separate the pieces.\n\n\n \n\nOXO's Solutions\n\nGet Pumped: The pump-style design makes it very easy for people of all ages and abilities to use without the need for significant hand strength or fine motor skills.\nDry Idea: Continuous turning in the same direction allows the Salad Spinner basket to achieve higher RPM than most other spinners, resulting in the driest, crispest lettuce possible.\nWon't Slip: A combination of a non-slip ring bonded to the bottom of the bowl and the downward force from the pump keep the Salad Spinner steady on the table, allowing users to operate it with just one hand.\nEasy-to-clean: The clear lid immediately signals whether there is leftover lettuce caught inside and it comes apart with a simple pull to wash thoroughly.\n\nThe OXO Story:\nIn 1990, OXO staged a revolution (of sorts) by offering an easy-to-use, high-performing alternative to uncomfortable and ineffective kitchen gadgets. OXO's innovative take on the traditional Swivel Peeler, complete with its pudgy black handle, raised consumers' expectations of what could be expected from household products.\nToday OXO offers over 800 products, each developed with a close (some might say \"obsessive\") attention to detail. Our goal is to deliver products that maximize comfort AND performance, illustrating our mission to create innovative consumer products that make everyday living easier.\nEver wonder what makes an OXO product an \"OXO Product\"?\nOXO employees believe there are two rules that should guide product development: First, every new product must deliver a significant improvement over the status quo. Second, the functionality should never be sacrificed to make the product more attractive  above all it should work well.\n\n\n\n\nEasy, one-handed operation; Patented pump mechanism and brake button\nSoft, non-slip knob locks down for storage; Non-slip ring and wide base keep bowl steady on countertop\nBasket can be used separately as a colander; Elegant, clear bowl is perfect for serving\nThe capacity is 4.49-quarts; Flat lid allows for convenient stacking when not in use\nClear lid disassembles for easy cleaning; Top-rack dishwasher safe\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDelivery & Shipping\n\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION\n\n\nMost orders are shipped within one business day with standard shipping and tracking number.

Their long-standing secret is the tight weave & \"cocoon effect\" that make this one of the most restful hammocks in the world.   THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL  Our colorful Brazilian Hammocks are not only comfortable but also aesthetically pleasing. They quickly become an essential part of your \"backyard oasis\" decor & serve to make neighbors jealous.   THEY LAST LONGER  Created in the same style that's been handed down for generations by artisans in Northeastern Brazil, they're tightly woven with high quality colorfast cotton thread, which ensures you'll enjoy your Brazilian Hammock for many years to come (contrary to flimsier string hammocks which easily come undone).   THEY'RE PORTABLE  Planning a camping trip or a lengthy backpacking excursion? This Brazilian Hammock easily fits in your backpack & provides a comfortable camp spot at the end of a tough day. Need a permanent relaxation spot in your yard, back porch, cottage or indoors? This beauty fits the bill. It's lightweight enough to be easily transported from one spot to the next or left in a one location on a permanent basis.   100% GUARANTEED  We stand behind our claim that you'll fall into \"Hammock Bliss\" the second you try it. If, for any reason, you aren't 100% happy with it, we'll give you your money back, no questions asked.   AAA What's Included: Hammock + FREE Carry Pouch  AAA Manufacturer's Warranty: 1 year  AAA Materials: 100% colorfast cotton  AAA Weight Capacity: 475 Pounds  AAA Recommended Hanging Distance: 12+ Feet (144+ Inches)  AAA Size: 2 People  AAA Store After Use: yes (in wet conditions)\n\nAAAAAA COCOON OF WEIGHTLESSNESS - Created in the style that has been handed down for generations by native artisans in Northeastern Brazil, these hammocks are tightly woven with comfortable, long-lasting colorfast cotton thread that gives the user a feeling of \"weightlessness\" - often described as laying on a soft sponge\nAAAAAA 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE - We dislike returns more than you do, so we make sure each one of our Hammocks is top-of-the-line exquisite quality. What we dislike even more than returns are folks that don't stand by their products and don't treat their customers with respect when there happens to be an issue. Rest assured, if you aren't 100% happy with this Hammock, we'll give you 100% of your money back, no questions asked\nAAAAAA HAMMOCK SIZE MATTERS - One way to differentiate between a high & poor quality Hammock is size. Our Brazilian Hammock's total length (from loop to loop) is 144 Inches while the bed resting area is 98 Inches Long X 59 Inches Wide\nAAAAAA GET BETTER SLEEP - If you've never had the experience of snoozing or sleeping overnight in a Brazilian Hammock, give yourself a treat. This Double Hammock is a perfect bed replacement thanks to it's closed weave & \"cradle\" effect (safe for those who move in their sleep). It's more economical, saves a ton of space & leads to deeper, more comfortable sleep when compared to a traditional mattress\nAAAAAA KIDS CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT - Our biggest customer complaint is that Mom & Dad can't get a \"turn\"... Set-it up in the backyard & just watch what happens when your little ones get a sight of it! This Hammock's kid-friendly design means the whole family can enjoy it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n \nYou may return all items within 30 days of delivery for a refund,  we'll provide a prepaid return label.
